{"name":"Cedalion-web","google":"","tagline":"","body":"# Welcome to cedalionWeb\r\ncedalionWeb is an open-source web application framework, built on top of the [Cedalion](http://cedalion.org) programming language.\r\n## Why another Web Framework?\r\nIndeed, there are so many web frameworks around.  Maybe a bit too many. We created cedalionWeb, not in-spite of the fact there are so many other frameworks around, but rather **because** of it. cedalionWeb's design is such that allows features that are typically defining features of a web framework, to be distributed as libraries.  With such a design, if you are unhappy with the HTML generation framework provided for cedalionWeb, you are free to create one yourself.  And if you do not like the approach we took for handling CRUD, you are free to develop your own utility.  By doing so, you are still free to use all the other parts of the framework you do like, and of-course, if your solution is reusable, you can publish it online to allow other users to benefit from it.","note":"Don't delete this file!
